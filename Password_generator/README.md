# Challenge #3 -easy

Password generator, let's the user choose number of digits, if it contains capitals or symbols. Also can pass a file to it.

To make it easier to pipe a file i printed info about usage to stderror instead of stdout but there might be a better solution. 

took ~35min but i think it's a bit better quality than the other two i have currently done 9/6/2023
